                        <span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:#303030">A railway may be defined as a high value, fixed guidance land transport system, carrying passengers and freight in purpose-built containers, using specifically designed, high power traction systems and controlled by high integrity safety systems. Railways are subject to strictly regulated safety regimes, require reliable long-distance communications and specially trained staff meeting defined medical requirements, sometimes working alone in hostile environments. The costs of construction, operation and maintenance of a railway does not normally offer a commercial return on investment and therefore requires substantial government subsidy, thus bringing with it a high degree of intrusive political&nbsp;interference and often malevolent media reporting.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:#454545"><p></p>

                        <span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:#303030">The life of railway assets is usually in the range of 20-40 years for electrical and mechanical systems and 60-120 years for fixed civil engineering infrastructure, assuming properly managed and regular maintenance. This life cycle drives a need for a long-term approach to the initial system design, to the strategic management of existing systems and to the development of replacement strategies.&nbsp;</span><span style="font-size:14.0pt;color:#454545"><p></p>
